# Knowledge Discovery Homework 2
Welcome to the second homework of the Knowledge Discovery course! You have the opportunity to test what you have learned so far on recurrent models. 
The homework can be done in groups of two/three students.
## Task Description

You will have about 2 weeks to solve a problem (sentiment analysis, machine translation, time series classification) on a dataset of your choice, which contains a sequence of data of whatever nature. Each task should be posed as a classification task (as the examples seen during classes), but conversely to CNN methods, the class changes over time (e.g., in case of machine translation, for each input work you have to predict a "class", i.e., the corresponding word). First you have to chose your data and build a custom dataset class or using an existing dataset which must be sensibly different than thoses seen during the practicals. As for HMW1, you’ll have to provide both code and data of your choice plus a summarization report of your work.
The report (max 4 pages) should be organized as follows:
-	Network description + figure.
-	Dataset description (classes, number of images per class, images size and augmentation) including training, validation and test splits + sample figure.
-	Training procedure (optimizer, hyperparams, loss, epochs, stopping criteria, batch size).
-	Performance analysis (training, validation and test accuracy and loss, confusion matrix).

For the report, you can use the link of the overleaf template provided for HW1.

## Submission Modality

To submit your homework you’ll have to create a GitHub repository (using your account) where you upload your notebok, dataset (zip folder with the images you’ve used) and a pdf report. The submission has to be performed filling the provided Google form.
