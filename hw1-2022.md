# Knowledge Discovery Homework 1
Welcome to the first Homework of the Knowledge Discovery course! You have the opportunity to test what you have learned so far. 
The homework can be done in groups of two students.
## Task Description

You will have about 2 weeks to solve a classification problem on a dataset of your choice, which contains images of several objects belonging to at least 5 different classes (at least 100 images per class). Being a classification problem, given an image, the goal is to predict the correct class label. First you have to chose your data and build a custom dataset class (CIFAR or MNIST are not accepted, don’t cheat!). You’ll have to provide both code and data of your choice plus a summarization report of your work.
The report (max 4 pages) should be organized as follows:
-	Network description + figure.
-	Dataset description (classes, number of images per class, images size and augmentation) including training, validation and test splits + sample figure.
-	Training procedure (optimizer, hyperparams, loss, epochs, stopping criteria, batch size).
-	Performance analysis (training, validation and test accuracy and loss, confusion matrix).
-	Ablation studies (test performance when adding incrementally layers to the model).

The link of the overleaf template is also provided.

If, for instance, your model holds 4 convolutional layers plus 1 fully connected and one classification layer, you have to test the performance in the following cases:
-	1st Conv layer + FC + Classifier.
-	1st + 2nd Conv layers + FC + Classifier.
-	1st + 2nd + 3rd Conv layers + FC + Classifier.
-	1st + 2nd + 3rd + 4th Conv layers + FC + Classifier.

## Submission Modality

To submit your homework you’ll have to create a GitHub repository (using your account) where you upload your notebok, dataset (zip folder with the images you’ve used) and a pdf report. The submission has to be performed filling the provided Google form.
